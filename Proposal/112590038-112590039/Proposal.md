Game Introduction
    I want to create a classic tower defense game in which
    player can build towers and he has to defense against the
    waves of enemies. When enemies reaches the defense tower,
    the hitpoints of tower decrease. When there is no hitpoint
    left, the game is over.
    
Timeline:
Week 1 : Collect game assets.
Week 2 : Create battle ground map and put enemies into the map.
Week 3 : Put towers into the map and test.
Week 4 : Put player's UI into the game.
Week 5 ... Upgrade the game.
